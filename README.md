# PiPeCOV
This project proposes to contribute to fill the knowledge gap about Covid-19SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and with the global knowledge about the pathogen. The scientific community and governments of other countries are looking for actions along these lines. The United Kingdom recently established a research network for genomic studies of SARS-CoV-2Covid-19 with a contribution of GBP 20 million (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-whole- genome-sequence-alliance-to-map-spread-of-coronavirus).
